# Use macOS shortcuts under Windows

This [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) configuration file.

1. map `CapsLock` to `Ctrl + Space`.
2. map usual keyboard shortcuts, eg: `map Command + A` to `Ctrl + A`.

> If it's not working for applications running with admin permissions, it might be the problem that AHK is not, see [this question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8457852/723769).
